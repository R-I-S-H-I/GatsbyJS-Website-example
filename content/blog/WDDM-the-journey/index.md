description: This is my amazing experience in Humber College.

Humber College is one of the best colleges in Canada where one can experience everything. I learned a lot
during my days at Humber. The WDDM winter 2021 is one of the best cohort/group (and I quote Lord Felice ðŸ˜‚) I have ever been in.
I accomplished a lot during this year. I met the best professors who taught me the concepts of web development and design.

## The First Semester...

#### The designing...

I am honoured to be in the guidance of such great teachers and friends during the course. Our group had about 25 students and we all came from different professional backgrounds. We always had stories to share amongst each other about our professional life. We were introduced to some basic concepts and tools required for design where we learned about using different Adobe Tools like -

- Adobe XD taught by **professor Felice Forte**.
- Adobe Illustrator taught by **professor Milorad Eftoski**.
- Adobe Photoshop taught by **professor Milorad Eftoski**.

Attending the lectures of **professor Milorad and professor Felice** gave us the understanding of industry standard way of **UI/UX design**. I personally learned a lot from them and now I can proudly say - if I make a career in the UI/UX designing feild, I can outperform and deliver the best for the industry.

#### The tools and workflow for web...

We were introduced to bash scripting ðŸ˜Ž, testing and basics of node JS in this course by our beloved **professor Jesse Mykolyn**. Being under his guidance was another great adventure we will all miss. His teaching style was the most unique, I would even say that if someone knows how to adapt and deliver the best on a virtual platform setting in a global pandemic it is without any doubt **professor Jesse Mykolyn**. _We all miss you very much professor_.

#### Applied web design and development...

If someone out in the world is seeking guidance and some support on there projects then, may I introdce you to the best -- _**professor Rocco Panacci**_. Well I don't have words to express myself what an awesome time we had under his guidance. If someone can devote time to really look after his students and can make a team of professors who do the same then there is only one and that is **professor Rocco Panacci**. He made us into the web developers we proudly are today. We couldn't have asked for anything more. I don't have enough words to thank him for his time and his contribution towards making our future better. He was the best at teaching us the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch.

## The Second Semester...

#### The designing...

Here we go again, another semester to go with. But, we are the best cohort and we have a group of the best professors. So all you can expect are great things. This semester we were introduced to the depths of UI/UX and motion design. With **professor Neil Van Der King** (the KING) we got to learn about more Adobe creative tools and UI/UX essential skills like -

1. Adobe After Effects.
2. Adobe Media Encoder.
3. The role of typography.
4. Visual effects.
5. Motion graphics.
6. Kinetic Typography concepts.

We had fun with the assignments we got in this course. The assignments were a great way to learn and explore about the artistic skills we all had inside of us. **Professor Neil Van Der King** would always appreciate our work and even teach us about various ways of applying different effects to our design. His teachings sparked my interest on taking the path of a UI/UX designer even more.

#### The web application programming...

Another professor this semester with a unique style of teaching. **Professor Hamid Noei** taught us about the use of APIs and how we can integrate these APIs in a website. We got to learn even more about the Node JS runtime environment and other framworks like Express JS. His style of teaching (as I mentioned) was very unique, he would always start to make an example of a web application from the very begining and explain us about each and every functionality which he wrote in the code. It helped us a lot to perfect our coding skills in JavaScript.
Thank you very much **professor Hamid Noei** for making us confident JavaScript developers.

#### Employment skills and portfolio design...

If there is someone who can assure you that you will land a succesful job with a very few amount of job applications then there is no one else other than **professo Cory Coletta**. Honestly, he boosted our moral and guided us to be more professional. With his teachings we all can conclude that we are not going to face any issues in the future related to the basics of buisness management. He sharpened our knowledge of client handling and helped us improve our soft skills. I can't thank you enough **professor Cory Coletta** for making my future bright and opening more doors to success.

#### Web application design and programming...

Another great semester with **professor Rocco Panacci**. He taught us about advanced topics of JavaScript and introduced us to the React JS Library, Webpack and Gatsby JS. We had a great time making the Ecommerce website (our major project) where we explored and learned about various hooks in React JS and we got to perform our best with all the knowledge and skills we added to our portfolio throughout this program.
